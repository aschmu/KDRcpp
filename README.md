# Kernel Dimension Reduction with RcppArmadillo

KDRcpp is a R/C++ port of the [KDR Matlab implementation](http://www.ism.ac.jp/~fukumizu/software.html) by K. Fukumizu.

KDR is a supervised dimension reduction method that uses RKHS to express conditional independance and find the dimension reduction subspace. It involves solving a non-trivial optimization problem.
